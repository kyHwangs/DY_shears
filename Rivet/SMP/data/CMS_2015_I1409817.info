Description:
'Differential cross section measurements of the Z($\rightarrow\mu\mu$) boson production in association with jets are presented, using 13 TeV proton-proton collisions data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 fb$^{-1}$. The cross sections are presented as a function of jet multiplicity, the jet transverse momenta, and the jet rapidity for different jet multiplicities. The cross section measurements are then compared with the predictions from a multileg next-to-leading-order Monte Carlo generator.'
Cuts: 'First two leading electrons or muons with $p_T > 20$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
     Dilepton invariant mass in the [71,111] GeV range
     Jets $p_T > 30$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
     $\Delta{R}($lepton,jet$) > 0.5$'
