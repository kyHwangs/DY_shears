RunInfo:
  'Run MC generators with Z decaying leptonically into both electrons and muons at 13 TeV CoM energy. Although The tau channel is not used it is safe to run on a sample that includes it. The cross section should be provided for a single leptonic decay channel. If only one (mumu or ee) channel is included in the MC, please apply a factor 2 in the provided cross section to compensate for the missing channel.'

Description:
'Differential cross section measurements of the Z($\rightarrow$ll) boson production in association with jets are presented, using 13 TeV proton-proton collisions data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 fb$^{-1}$. The cross sections are presented as a function of jet multiplicity, the jet transverse momenta, and the jet rapidity for different jet multiplicities. The cross section measurements are then compared with the predictions from a multileg next-to-leading-order Monte Carlo generator.'
Cuts: 'First two leading electrons or muons with $p_T > 20$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
     Dilepton invariant mass in the [71,111] GeV range
     Jets $p_T > 30$ GeV and $|y| < 2.4$
     $R($lepton,jet$) > 0.4$'
