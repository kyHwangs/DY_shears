Description:
'A measurement of the differential cross sections for a W boson produced in association with jets in the muon decay channel is presented. The measurement is based on 13$\,$TeV proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$2.2\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The cross sections are reported as functions of jet multiplicity, jet transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ , jet rapidity, the scalar $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ sum of the jets, and angular correlations between the muon and the jet for different jet multiplicities. The measured cross sections are in agreement with predictions that include multileg leading-order (LO) and next-to-LO matrix element calculations interfaced with parton showers, as well as a next-to-next-to-LO calculation for the W boson and one jet production.'

Cuts: 'Leading muon with $p_T > 25$ GeV and $\eta < 2.4$
     $m_T(\mu,\nu) > 50$ GeV
     Jets $p_T > 30$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
     $\Delta{R}($lepton,jet$) > 0.4$'
