# Rivet packages

This directory is organized similarly to the CMS rivet git repository https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-gen/Rivet to ease the submission of the package to CMS GEN group.

This Rivet directory must be copied to your $CMSSW_BASE/src to be used with CMSSW. Instead of copying the directory you can used a symbolic link: <code>cd $CMSSW_BASE/src; ln -s ...../shears/Rivet .</code>.
